Predicting portable water quality is more effective for water management and water pollution prevention.
Predicting the quality of drinkable water may reduce the incidence of water-related diseases.
Several parameters were used to predict the quality of the water.
Different machine learning algorithms were used to determine water quality for drinking.
It helps to humans for identifying quickly whether the water is drinkable or not.
